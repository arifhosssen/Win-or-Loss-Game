# Win-or-Loss-Game
The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock as ('r), paper as ('p'), or scissors as ('s'). Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it. Here you play with a computer.
